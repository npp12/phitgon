<center>Weight loss for men</center>
<p>Here are some weight loss excercises for men:</p><br>
<p>Shadow Boxing </p>
<p><li>This excercise is done by pretending to be boxing</li></p><br>
<p>Box Jumps</p>
<p><li>This excercise is done by jumping on a box.</li></p><br>
<p>Skipping </p>
<p><li>jump over a rope which is held at both ends by oneself or two other people and turned repeatedly over the head and under the feet, as a game or for exercise.</li></p><br>
<p>Mountain Climbers</p>
<p>
 <li> Set up on the floor as though in a sprinter's blocks, with one foot positioned beneath your waist and one back, with your leg straight</li>
<br>
<li> Explosively swap foot positions </li>
<br>
<li> Repeat for the prescribed reps</li>
</p><br>
<p>Bear Crawlers</p>
<p>
    <li> Begin on all fours with your hands under shoulders and your knees under your hips â€” all lifted off the floor</li><br>
<li> Keep hips slightly higher than the shoulders, chin tucked in and head in a neutral position</li>
<br>
<li> As you reach with the right arm, reach with the left foot so opposite arm and leg work together as you begin to move forward</li>
<br>
<li> Keeping your hips even throughout the movement, begin with small steps until you've mastered both movement and co-ordination</li>
