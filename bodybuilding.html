    <center>excercises without gym equipment</center>
    <p>There is an actual way to bodybuild without gym equipment and here it is:</p>
    <p>    Push-up: 3–6 sets of 6–12 reps</p> <br>
        <p>A push-up is a conditioning exercise performed in a prone position by raising and lowering the body with the straightening and bending of the arms while keeping the back straight and supporting the body on the hands and toes.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Burpee: 6 per minute for 15 minutes</p> <br>
        <p>A burpee is essentially a two-part exercise: a pushup followed by a leap in the air. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Plank-up: 3 sets of 5–10 reps</p> <br>
        <p>Start in a push-up position with the hands under the shoulders and the legs stretched out directly behind. Squeeze the thigh and glute muscles to keep body and legs in a straight line, and lower down to the elbows one elbow at a time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Triceps dip: 2 sets of 10–12 reps</p> <br>
    	<p>Tricep dips can be performed on parallel bars at your gym or even on a playground. You hold your entire body weight up with your arms extended and feet hovering over the floor, ankles crossed. Lower your body until your elbows reach a 90-degree angle before returning to your starting position.</p>    
    <p>     Inchworm: 3 sets of 4–6 reps</p> <br>
    <br>
    <p> Step-up: 3 sets of 15 reps (each side)</p> <br>
    <p> Pushing primarily through your lead foot, lift your body up onto the step. Then step backward to the starting position. When you're doing step-ups, keep your back straight and your abdominal muscles nice and tight. Make sure your foot is planted entirely on the step.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Lunge: 3 sets of 15 reps (each side)</p> <br>
    <p>A lunge is an exercise in which a person in a standing position steps forward into a position in which the front knee is deeply bent while keeping the torso erect and then returns back to the starting position.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Squat: 3–5 sets of 8–12 reps</p>
     <p>A squat is a strength exercise in which the person lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. </p>
